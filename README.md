# Paper Collector for Synthetic Biology Research
A tool for systematically collecting and analyzing academic papers to understand research networks, collaborations, and institutional relationships in synthetic biology.
## Overview
This project helps map the academic landscape by building a knowledge graph that connects:

- Authors → Institutions → Research Areas → Papers
- Collaboration patterns between labs
- Research topic clusters and emerging areas
- Citation networks and influence patterns
